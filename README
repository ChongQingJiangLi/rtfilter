                               RTFILTER



Presentation
============

This package provides a library written in C implementing realtime digital
filtering functions for multichannel signals (i.e. filtering multiple
signals with the same filter). The core library implements FIR and IIR
filtering for float and double data type. Additional functions are also
provided to design few usual filters: Butterworth, Chebyshev, windowed
sinc...

In addition, the filter functions have been especially optimized for
multichannel signals. If data allows it (and if enabled at the
configuration of the package), the library automatically switch to
optimized SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) code, allowing to reduce
by 3~4 the time spent in processing the data.


Supported platforms
===================

Any POSIX platform. The SIMD code is possible if the host CPU supports SSE2
or later instruction sets (Intel pentium4, AMD k8 or later processors
support SSE2).


Compilation
===========

This library is organized as a GNU package and can be compiled and
installed in the same way (see INSTALL file for further information).
